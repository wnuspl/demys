# docs

This is the first file in the project to be written using demys! This means that the editor is probably at a point where it needs a usage guide.

# starting demys

`demys`  

Starting with no arguments will open an explorer tab.

`demys [file1] [file2] [file...]`  

Passing file paths as arguments will open all the files in separate tabs.

# navigation

To cycle through tabs, press `Tab`.\
When on a tab, press `Ctrl+l` to split into a new window.\
To cycle through windows, press `Ctrl-n`.\
Press `Esc` to exit.
- note: demys will NOT warn about unsaved work.

# text editing

demys supports only basic text editting.
- Arrow keys
- Backspace
- Enter
- Save with `F12`

# explorer tab

Use this tab to open files within your current directory.\
Press (j/Down) or (k/Up) to move your cursor, and enter to open/close directories or open a file.
